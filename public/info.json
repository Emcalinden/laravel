		"text": "There are examples for linear recurrence relations. This is a good place to start if you are not too familiar with the subject. Once you grasp this you can then look at the Mathematical Induction of the Linear recurrences. Once you are confident in them you should move on to the quadratic recurrence relations and mathematical induction. You should really go over the examples before you move onto the Interactive area so you really get the full understanding and benefits."

		"name": "interactive",
		"text": "The Interactive area is a feature to help you on a step by step basis. Letting you enter your own recurrence relation and taking you through the problem. There are hints throughout if you get stuck, but the aim is that you attempt to work out the problem yourself and enter your values to the website to see if you have got it correct. Once you have finished the recurrence relation you will get to see how to solve it by mathematical Induction."

The review are will have a table of all your previous scores and you will see it displayed on a graph. This will let you know if you are making progress. It is good to keep track of progress, and try to beat your scores. This will help you in preparation for any assignments or exams covering these topics."
